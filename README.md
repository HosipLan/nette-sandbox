foglcz's sandbox
================
This is an sandbox, which I, @foglcz, use. It contains several addons:

- it's Dibi based
- it contains composer.json and appropiate gitignores
- the authenticator is mcrypt based - there's no cheap md5's, there's no static salts
- the way of working with models is easier - with use of dibi of course.

And mainly - it's tested and proven by time.
